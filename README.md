# Alcohol Suggestions Project

## Description
We are pleased to bring you the most recent version of our Alchol Reccommendation application! Have you ever been home on a rainy evening, know you want something to drink, but your usual go-to beer just doesn't tickle your fancy? SO HAVE WE! There are so many different cocktails and wines out there for you to try, but finding a starting point can be overwhelming- and that's where this application comes in. Whether you just turned 21 and want a good place to start, or are a seasoned veteran just looking for a mid-week change up, this application is the one for you. 
No longer will you have to drink the same old drink and/or wine, day-in and day-out!

## Installation

There is no installation required, as this application is ran entirely on the web. Simply go to the provided URL in this document. 

## Usage

To use this application, the user must first decide whether they would like a drink suggestion for a cocktail or wine. From there the user simply clicks on whatever button they are feeling at the moment, and the application will spit out a variety of drink options for them.

## Credits

This project had 3 collaboators working together to get it off the ground. All credit goes to the Github users gregorywyrick, Bradenwales0, and Gthornes61. Thank you for all of your help.
